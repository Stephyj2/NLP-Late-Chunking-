In a world where the ability to extract, organize, and query knowledge from unstructured data is becoming essential, RAGraphX v1 is a game-changer. This innovative real-time GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application integrates LangChain, Neo4j, and OpenAIâ€™s GPT models to provide a seamless experience for extracting knowledge from documents and querying it in real-time through natural language.

Key Features of RAGraphX v1:

- Real-time document processing with the ability to upload PDFs, extract entities, and store them in a Neo4j graph database.
- Users can query the graph using natural language, which is converted into Cypher queries, enabling real-time interaction with the extracted data.
- Configurable access to both OpenAI and Neo4j, making the app adaptable to different needs.
- Modular architecture for easy integration and extensibility for future development.

How It Works:

1. Users upload PDF documents to the app, which are processed using the powerful capabilities of LangChain and OpenAI GPT models. The app identifies key entities and relationships within the text and stores them in a graph format using Neo4j.
2. Once the graph is created, users can interact with the knowledge stored in Neo4j by asking questions in natural language. The app uses a specially designed prompt to generate Cypher queries, retrieve data from the graph, and return the answer in real-time.
3. This application is built using Streamlit, which allows for a smooth, user-friendly web interface. It can be deployed easily and run locally with the help of localtunnel.

RAGraphX v1 demonstrates the power of combining advanced natural language models like GPT with graph databases for intuitive and effective knowledge retrieval. It is designed with extensibility in mind, and future iterations will focus on adding more features such as visualizing the graph structure and supporting larger datasets.

This project is ideal for those who need to extract meaningful insights from large unstructured text corpora and interact with the information in real-time using natural language queries.
